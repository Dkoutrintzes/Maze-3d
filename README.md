# Maze Unity
This is a graphical simulation developed in Unity based on the real world experiment from [1] and used from the [H-AI_collab_game](https://github.com/ligerfotis/maze_RL_online)

This forked from https://github.com/panos-stavrianos/MazeUnity and adjusted accordingly for our purposes.

The environment receives actions (plus other important information) and sends back observations (plus other important information) to H-AI_collab_game.

The above messages are being exchanged via an HTTP server.

H-AI_collab_game and maze_GI_Unity work as HTTP clients.

### Edit MazeUnity
* Download git
  
      git clone https://github.com/Dkoutrintzes/Maze-3d.git
